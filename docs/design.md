# Design notes

This document summarizes the major design goals and architecture choices for the
Rust implementation.

## Goals

- Preserve external behavior and wire compatibility where feasible.
- Improve safety by minimizing unsafe code and isolating FFI boundaries.
- Maintain or improve performance relative to the C implementation.

## Architecture (Rust workspace)

Crates are organized so core logic and performance-sensitive code are isolated:

- slipstream-core: shared types, parsing, and TCP helpers.
- slipstream-dns: DNS codec, base32, and dot formatting logic.
- slipstream-ffi: picoquic FFI bindings and runtime helpers.
- slipstream-client: CLI and client runtime.
- slipstream-server: CLI and server runtime.

## QUIC and multipath

Multipath QUIC support is provided by picoquic. The Rust code uses an FFI wrapper
so the application logic is in Rust while keeping multipath behavior intact.
Unsafe code is constrained to the FFI layer, and higher-level APIs avoid raw
pointer exposure where possible.

## DNS codec

The DNS codec is intentionally minimal and treats parsing as an attack surface:

- Strict bounds checks on message length and label lengths.
- Hard caps on decoded payload sizes.
- Explicit error handling with drop vs reply behavior.

Golden vectors (fixtures/vectors/dns-vectors.json) are treated as the source of
truth for DNS behavior.

## Event loop and concurrency

The runtime centers around a connection manager that owns QUIC state, timers, and
per-connection queues. UDP receive/send and TCP accept/read/write are handled by
separate tasks, with bounded channels used to limit memory growth under load.

## Safety and shutdown

- CLI validation enforces required flags and valid host:port parsing.
- Backpressure is applied via connection-level max_data.
- Shutdown follows explicit states (drain, close, force terminate) to avoid hangs
  and minimize data loss.

## Performance strategy

- Measure first with benchmark harnesses (see docs/benchmarks.md).
- Reuse buffers and avoid per-packet allocations in the hot path.
- Keep the DNS codec simple and predictable.
- Make logging configurable and avoid hot-path overhead by default.

## Testing and interop

- DNS codec behavior is validated against golden vectors.
- Interop harnesses ensure Rust <-> C compatibility.
- Integration tests cover local loopback and shutdown behavior.
