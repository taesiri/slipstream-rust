This page documents runtime knobs and environment variables.

## Client and server environment variables

- SLIPSTREAM_STREAM_WRITE_BUFFER_BYTES
  Overrides the connection-level QUIC max_data limit used for backpressure.
  Default is 8 MiB. Values must be positive integers.

These affect the build script in crates/slipstream-ffi:

- PICOQUIC_AUTO_BUILD
  Set to 0 to disable auto-building picoquic when headers/libs are missing.

- PICOQUIC_DIR
  picoquic source tree (default: vendor/picoquic).

- PICOQUIC_INCLUDE_DIR
  picoquic headers directory (default: vendor/picoquic/picoquic).

- PICOQUIC_BUILD_DIR
  picoquic build output (default: .picoquic-build).

- PICOQUIC_LIB_DIR
  Directory containing picoquic and picotls libraries.

## Script environment variables

Interop and benchmark scripts accept environment variables for ports, domains,
and paths. See docs/interop.md and docs/benchmarks.md for details.
